First of all, I am very happy to have the opportunity of taking this technical test!

The requirement is implemented with Java and Typescript in two separated projects:statement-backend and statement-frontend.

In project statement-backend is Spring Boot applied. The most important reason of choosing Spring Boot is the embedded Tomcat.
With this Tomcat, the application can start up standalone.  It serve not only command line command's but also web pages from the browsers.
For this small test case is this convenient.

The project statement-front uses framework Angular 5.

For getting the application running, please take a look at README.md in the projects


Kind regards,

Xiaolin Song
